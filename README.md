Hello world!

My name is Cornex, now I'm 21 y/o and I wanna find my way in life.
I like playing games and I wand to make interesting games for others, that's why I start learning Java, Lua and "CoronaLabs" Engine. 
In the future I'll create something special and be proud of myself...

I hope in 10-15 years I will not forget about this.
